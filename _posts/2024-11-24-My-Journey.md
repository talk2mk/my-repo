### My Journey in Neuropsychology - Bridging Cultures, Healing Minds

When I first stepped into the world of psychology, I never imagined the incredible path that lay ahead. My journey has been anything but conventional – from the classrooms of Mumbai to conducting ethnographic research in Greece, and facilitating therapy with asylum-seeking children, each experience has shaped my understanding of human resilience.

My academic journey began at L.S. Raheja College, where I graduated as a Psychology Valedictorian. This was more than just an academic achievement; it was a declaration of my commitment to understanding the human mind. At the University of Mumbai, my clinical psychology specialization opened my eyes to the nuanced world of mental health support.

The turning point came during my Master's in Neuropsychology at the National Forensic Sciences University. Here, I wasn't just learning theories; I was exploring the intricate connections between the central nervous system, cognition, and human behavior. My thesis on the 4-7-8 breathing technique wasn't just research – it was a glimpse into how innovative approaches can transform mental health interventions.

My professional experiences have been equally diverse. As an Assistant Professor, I didn't just teach psychology – I reimagined education. Transitioning courses online during challenging times, I learned that adaptability is perhaps the most crucial psychological skill. Conducting seminars on research software, organizing parent workshops, I saw education as a holistic process of understanding and support.

Clinical work has been the heart of my journey. From internships at Grant Government Medical College to working with Teach for India, I've witnessed the profound impact of culturally sensitive psychological support. Whether it was administering learning disability assessments or conducting workshops on mental health awareness, each interaction has been a lesson in human complexity.

My work with expat communities and cross-cultural populations has been particularly close to my heart. I've developed a deep understanding of how cultural transitions impact mental health, creating targeted interventions that respect individual experiences.

One of my most transformative experiences was an experimental walk to Albania, where I facilitated group drumming therapy with asylum-seeking children. It was a powerful reminder that healing transcends language, culture, and traditional therapeutic boundaries.

Today, as a Neuropsychologist, I approach each client with a holistic, integrative perspective. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, trauma-informed care, assertiveness training – these aren't just methodologies. They're pathways to personal growth, resilience, and self-discovery.

To everyone reading this – your mental health journey is unique. It's not about fixing something broken, but about understanding, growing, and empowering yourself. Whether you're navigating personal challenges, professional transitions, or cultural adjustments, remember: you're not alone.

My mission continues to be creating compassionate, evidence-based psychological support that sees and honors your individual story.
